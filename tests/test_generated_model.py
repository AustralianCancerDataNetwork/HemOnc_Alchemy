"""Smoke test for the currently committed generated model.

Confirms model/entities.py isn't just syntactically valid (that's
compiler/validate.py's job) but actually *works* as SQLAlchemy: every class
imports, every relationship (declarative and soft/inferred) resolves to a
real class, and the resulting schema is valid, creatable SQL. This is a
materially higher bar than "the file parses" -- two real bugs were only
caught by actually running this exact check against the real regenerated
output (a missing `datetime` import, and a genuine HemOnc column literally
named `relationship` shadowing the imported `relationship()` function
within its own class body).

Skipped if entities.py is still the empty placeholder (no `regen` has been
run yet in this checkout).
