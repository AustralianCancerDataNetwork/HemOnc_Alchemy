"""Tests for the notebooks' shared classification rules.

`notebooks/_taxonomy.py` is not part of the installed package -- it is a
helper the optional demonstration notebooks import. When the notebook bundle
is present locally, it is tested here because several notebooks depend on it
and their published figures change if it drifts. Package CI may not check out
the ignored notebook bundle, so the module-level import is intentionally
optional.
