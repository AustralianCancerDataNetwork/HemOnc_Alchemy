"""Following HemOnc's cross-references between sigs, studies, variants and
conditions.

Some of these links are only recorded as free text — a `study` field holding
several study names separated by `|`, for example — so resolving them means
splitting that text and looking the names up. That is a best-effort match on
what the source wrote, not a guaranteed join, and a name that doesn't resolve
is simply absent from the result rather than raising.

Each function takes an entity and returns the related entities, deduplicated.
Several issue their own queries, so the entity must be attached to a session.
